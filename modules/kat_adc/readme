The KAT ADC consists of 3 modules, the kat_adc_interface is the main controller
, it brings in the data from the ADC over the ZDOKs and presents it to the 
user.

The iic and spi controllers manage the configuration of the ADC, this is done
over the ZDOK connectors, which provide the iic and spi interface to the ADC.
These modules are connected ot the wishbone bus making them accessable from
software.
